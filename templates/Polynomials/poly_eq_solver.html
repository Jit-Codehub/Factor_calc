	<div class="card-header"><h2 class="h2">What is Meant by the Polynomial Equation Solver?</</h2></div>
	<div class="card-body">
		<p>An algebraic equation that includes variables, Constance, coefficients, and many mathematical operators is called a polynomial equation in mathematics. Also, it has several terms with different exponents.</p>
		<p>Linear polynomial equations, quadratic polynomial equations, cubic polynomial equations, and so on are some of the different polynomial equation types. You can solve the degree of a polynomial equation and the variables of the polynomial expression by the Polynomial Equation Solver.</p>
		<p>Want to know and learn the simple methods to solve the polynomial equation then look at the modules below &amp; gain complete knowledge on the concept of equation solver.</p>
		<h3>How to Solve a Polynomial Equation using Synthetic Division Method?</h3>
		<p>Follow the below simple steps to solve the polynomial equations with the synthetic division method:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Firstly, you need to study the given polynomial equation.</li>
		<li>Rearrange the equation by getting all the variables to one side and constants to another side.</li>
		<li>Determine the one number that meets your expression by verifying the factors of constant.</li>
		<li>Consider all the coefficients of the polynomial expression.</li>
		<li>Take out the first number accordingly and follow the division method for the rest of the coefficients.</li>
		<li>Automatically, the last value turns to zero.</li>
		<li>Note down the equation with the help of obtained values.</li>
		<li>Do the same process for getting the other values.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps for Solving a Polynomial Equation by Factoring</h3>
		<p>The method of factoring to solve the polynomial equation is explained here. Follow the process of solving polynomial equations using factoring and get the answers manually.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Consider the given polynomial equation</li>
		<li>Take variable values to one side and the other side must be zero where the equation needs to be in the form of ax^n+ax^n-1+ax^n-2--ax=0. </li>
		<li>Find the solutions of x by factors.</li>
		<li>Later, use the formula for factoring the respective equation. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>In order to understand the above process very easily, we have explained the steps with the solved example below. Look at the example and do practice with other example polynomials using the synthetic division method:</p>
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p>Solve 2x^2+3x&minus;5 = 0 with factorization method?</p>
		<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
		<p>Given equation is 2x^2+3x&minus;5 = 0</p>
		<p>Break the expression into groups ie.,</p>
		<p>(2x^2&minus;2x)+(5x&minus;5)</p>
		<p>Factor out 2x from 2x^2&minus;2x: 2x(x&minus;1)</p>
		<p>Factor out 5 from 5x&minus;5: 5(x&minus;1)</p>
		<p>=2x(x&minus;1)+5(x&minus;1)</p>
		<p>=(x-1)(2x+5)</p>
		<p>Find the x terms from above resultant</p>
		<p>x-1=0</p>
		<p>x= 1</p>
		<p>2x+5=0</p>
		<p>2x=-5</p>
		<p>x=-5/2</p>
		<p>Hence, the values of x are 1, -5/2.</p>
