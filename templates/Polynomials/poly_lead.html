    <div class="card-header"><h2 class="h2">What is Meant by Leading Term and Leading Coefficient?</h2></div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The leading term of a polynomial is defined as the term which is having the highest degree in the expression. The coefficient of the highest degree of a polynomial is called the leading coefficient of the polynomial. The greatest exponential value of the individual term in the expression is called the degree of a polynomial.</p>
      <h3>How to Solve the Leading Term &amp; Coefficient of a Polynomial?</h3>
      <p>The small steps that are required to follow while calculating the leading term and leading coefficient of a polynomial are listed below:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Initially, Find the highest exponent of the variable in the given polynomial to define the degree.</li>
      <li>Now, identify the term including the highest power of variable to solve the leading term.</li>
      <li>To solve the leading coefficient, identify the coefficient of the leading term.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We hope the steps cleared all your doubts regarding how to find the leading term of a polynomial if not then take a look at the solved example below.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
      <p>Find the degree, the leading coefficient, and the leading term of 6x^6+5x^6-4x^4+2x^3+3x^2+6x+20.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given polynomial expression is 5x^5-4x^4+2x^3+3x^2+6x+20</p>
      <p>The degree of the polynomial is the greatest exponent value in the given polynomial terms. Here, the degree is <strong>6.</strong></p>
      <p>The leading term is the term with the highest degree. Here, <strong>5x^6</strong> is the leading term. </p>
      <p>The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term. Here, <strong>5</strong> is the leading coefficient.</p>
