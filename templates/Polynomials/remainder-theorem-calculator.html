            <p>In mathematics, the remainder theorem states that when a polynomial p(x) is divided by the linear factor x-a, then the remainder of the polynomial division is equal to p(a).
              General division formula is dividend = (divisor * quotient) + remainder
              Remainder theorem of a polynomial formula is p(x) = (x-a) * (q(x) + r(x)
              Where,
              p(x) is the dividend
              x-a is divisor
              q(x) is the quotient
              r(x) is the remainder.
              </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Question:  Divide polynomial x²-3x+2 by the linear expression x+2 and find the remainder.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Given values are</p>
            <p>Given polynomial is f(x) = x²-3x+2</p>
            <p>Linear expression is x+2</p>
            <p>When x+2=0, then x=-2</p>
            <p>Substitute x=-2 in f(x)</p>
            <p>So, f(-2)=(-2)²-3(-2)+2</p>
            <p>=4+6+2</p>
            <p>The remainder of given polynomial is 3.</p>

     	<p class="answer">If a polynomial f(x) is divided by the linear x - a, then the remainder of the polynomial expression is f(x) = (x-a) * q(x) + r(x). Where q(x) is the quotient, r(x) is the remainder.</p><hr>
     	<p class="question"><strong>2. How do you find the remainder theorem on a calculator?</strong></p>
     	<p class="answer">You have to give the dividend polynomial and division linear function as inputs and click on the calculate button. It gives the remainder of the polynomial as output.</p><hr>  
        <p class="question"><strong>3. Is the factor theorem and remainder theorem the same?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">According to the remainder theorem, a polynomial f(x) is divided by x-a gives the remainder as f(a). In the factor theorem, if "a" is the zero of a polynomial f(x) then x-a is the factor of f(x) or vice versa.</p><hr>
        <p class="question"><strong>4. Can you use the remainder theorem If the remainder is zero?</strong></p>
     	<p class="answer">The remainder of polynomial expressions becomes zero when it is divided by factor. You can use the polynomial remainder theorem at any case of polynomial function but the divisor must be a binomial in the form of x-a.
